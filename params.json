{"name":"Simply Responsive Content","tagline":"Add ZURB Foundation's visibility classes to tt_content elements.","body":"# Simply Responsive Content\r\n\r\nSimply Responsive Content is a small [TYPO3](http://www.typo3.org) extension providing a 'Responsive Settings' tab on all tt_content elements.\r\n\r\nUpon selecting one or more of the responsive visibility settings the respective classes will be added to the normal classes on a content element.\r\n\r\nThis extension is intended to be used with ZURB's Foundation framework.\r\n\r\n## What it _doesn't_ do...\r\n\r\n1. it doesn't create your website for you\r\n2. it doesn't clear you from the duty of mastering TypoScript\r\n3. it doesn't install ZURB Foundation for you (you should have made your own templates and include Foundation on your own!)\r\n\r\n## What it _does_ do...\r\n\r\n1. Provides a tab on all content elements where editors can select the different visibility classes for that element. On rendering the selected classes will then be added to the default class wrapping for that element. That's all. Nothing more. Nothing less.\r\n\r\n## How to use...\r\n\r\n1. Install the extension like any other TYPO3 extension.\r\n2. Include the static templates.\r\n3. Et voila: you'll see the responsive settings tab there, working and all.\r\n\r\n## Running into issues?\r\n\r\nPlease check first if nothing is actually overriding the `tt_content.stdWrap.innerWrap.cObject.default.20` section in your TypoScript.\r\n\r\nThe classes are added where the default csc classes are also loaded. If you have changed this, you can modify the TypoScript to fit your needs.\r\n\r\n## Really running into issues?\r\n\r\nEither fix it and do a pull request on Github or create an issue there...
